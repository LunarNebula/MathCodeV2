The following are items for future work in this Java project.
-------------
ALGORITHMS TO FIX:
*Boolean operators in BST.java to improve time complexity from n^2 to n and reduce average-case space complexity
    *AND     complete
    *OR      complete
    *XOR     complete
    *AND_NOT incomplete
*Tree functions in Combinatorics.java that are inoperable
*Permutations.java (everything) - computation cycle algorithm doesn't work
-------------
CLASSES/PACKAGES/CONCEPTS TO FINISH:
*Physics package
*Run 10/11 undetermined Busy Beaver candidates?
*Finish PermutationTest with updated indexing and run against Permutation
*Finish RadixTest and run against Radix/BigInteger
-------------
