FORMAT:
State list (length 'm'), separated by spaces
Cell input list (length 'n'), separated by spaces
The following in an mXn grid, with indices I<m and J<n {
    (for State I, on cell with cellState J)
    -The next state
    -The new cell value
    -The direction of movement (L,R,H)
}
Initial state " " default cell value

NOTES:
Separate values in each element in the grid above with dashes.

EXAMPLE (5 states, 2 cell values):
A B C D E           <- 5 states
0 1                 <- 2 cell conditions
B-1-R C-1-L         <- 5x2 table grouping next state, new cell value, new movement direction
C-1-R B-1-R
D-1-R E-0-L
A-1-L D-1-L
E-1-H A-0-L
A 0                 <- Initial conditions (initial state, default cell value)
